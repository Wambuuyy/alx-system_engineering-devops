# Project Title: 0x04 Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

## Overview
This project focuses on enhancing your skills in scripting, specifically in using loops, conditions, and parsing in the Bash scripting language. The tasks involve creating scripts to perform various operations, such as displaying messages, analyzing Apache logs, and processing data from system files.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

- Create SSH RSA key pairs.
- Utilize while, until, and for loops in Bash scripts.
- Implement if, else, elif, and case condition statements.
- Use the cut command for text processing.
- Understand and apply file and comparison operators.
- Ensure script portability and adherence to best practices.
- Perform tasks related to system administration and scripting in a Linux environment.

## Project Structure
The project directory should be organized as follows:

- **0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/**
  - **0-RSA_public_key.pub**: Contains the public key generated in Task 0.
  - **1-for_best_school**: Bash script for Task 1.
  - **2-while_best_school**: Bash script for Task 2.
  - **3-until_best_school**: Bash script for Task 3.
  - **4-if_9_say_hi**: Bash script for Task 4.
  - **5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance**: Bash script for Task 5.
  - **6-superstitious_numbers**: Bash script for Task 6.
  - **7-clock**: Bash script for Task 7.
  - **8-for_ls**: Bash script for Task 8.
  - **9-to_file_or_not_to_file**: Bash script for Task 9.
  - **10-fizzbuzz**: Bash script for Task 10.
  - **100-read_and_cut**: Bash script for Task 11.
  - **101-tell_the_story_of_passwd**: Bash script for Task 12.
  - **102-lets_parse_apache_logs**: Bash script for Task 13.
  - **103-dig_the-data**: Bash script for Task 14.
  - **apache-access.log**: Sample Apache log file for Tasks 13 and 14.
  - **README.md**: Project README file.

## Execution Instructions
1. Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Wambuuyy/alx-system_engineering-devops).
2. Navigate to the `0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing` directory.
3. Execute the desired Bash script using the appropriate command (e.g., `./1-for_best_school`).

## Additional Notes
- All scripts must adhere to the specified requirements and pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any errors.
- Ensure that each Bash script begins with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` on the first line.
- Include a comment on the second line of each script explaining its purpose.
- Avoid using awk in Tasks 1-10 and use it explicitly in Tasks 13 and 14 as instructed.
- Commit the generated RSA public key (`0-RSA_public_key.pub`) and the sample Apache log file (`apache-access.log`).
- Regularly check the README for any updates or additional instructions.
