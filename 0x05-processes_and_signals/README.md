# 0x05. Processes and Signals

## Description

This repository contains solutions to the "0x05. Processes and Signals" DevOps project. The project focuses on understanding processes, PIDs, signals, and creating Bash scripts to perform various tasks related to process management.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Understand what a PID (Process ID) is.
- Recognize and manage processes in Linux.
- Learn about signals in Linux and how they can be used.
- Create Bash scripts for process management.
- Gain knowledge about process termination and signal handling.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of process and signal management. The tasks include:

1. **What is my PID:** Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

2. **List your processes:** Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

3. **Show your Bash PID:** Write a Bash script that displays lines containing the word "bash," allowing you to get the PID of your Bash process.

4. **Show your Bash PID made easy:** Write a Bash script that displays the PID and process name of processes containing the word "bash."

5. **To infinity and beyond:** Write a Bash script that displays "To infinity and beyond" indefinitely.

6. **Don't stop me now:** Write a Bash script that stops the process created in the previous task.

7. **Stop me if you can:** Write a Bash script that stops the process created in the "To infinity and beyond" task.

8. **Highlander:** Write a Bash script that displays "To infinity and beyond" and handles signals, displaying "I am invincible!!!" when receiving a SIGTERM signal.

9. **Beheaded process:** Write a Bash script that kills the process created in the "Highlander" task.

10. **Process and PID file:** Write a Bash script that creates a PID file, displays messages, and handles signals for termination.

11. **Manage my process:** Write a Bash script that manages the execution of another script, allowing start, stop, and restart operations.

12. **Zombie:** Write a C program that creates 5 zombie processes.

## How to Use

Each task is implemented in separate script files. To execute a specific task, run the corresponding script in the terminal.

For example:

```bash
./0-what-is-my-pid
./1-list_your_processes
./2-show_your_bash_pid
# ... and so on
```

Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the task descriptions. Additionally, refer to the README.md file for specific requirements and details about each task.
