# Regular Expression Project - 0x06

## Overview
This project focuses on mastering regular expressions using the Oniguruma library, commonly used in Ruby. The tasks involve creating Ruby scripts that leverage regular expressions to match specific patterns. The project is scheduled to start on Jan 30, 2024, at 6:00 AM and must conclude by Jan 31, 2024, at 6:00 AM. The checker will be released on Jan 30, 2024, at 12:00 PM, with an auto review launched at the deadline.

## Concepts
The primary concept explored in this project is Regular Expressions. Participants are expected to familiarize themselves with Oniguruma and use it to build regular expressions. A sample Ruby code is provided as a reference, demonstrating the usage of regular expressions with Oniguruma.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts ARGV[0].scan(/127.0.0.[0-9]/).join
```
