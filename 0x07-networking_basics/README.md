### Tasks
#### 0. OSI model
- OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model describing layered communication and computer network design.
- Organized from the lowest level (layer 1) for physical transmission to the highest level (layer 7) for application-specific communication.
- Focus in this project: Transport layer (TCP/UDP) and Network layer (IP and ICMP).

**Questions:**
1. What is the OSI model?
   - Set of specifications for network hardware manufacturers.
   - Conceptual model characterizing communication functions without regard to internal structure.
   - Model characterizing communication functions with a strong regard for internal structure and technology.
   
2. How is the OSI model organized?
   - Alphabetically
   - From the lowest to the highest level
   - Randomly

#### 1. Types of network
- LAN connects local devices, WAN connects LANs, and WANs operate over the Internet.

**Questions:**
1. What type of network is a computer in local connected to?
   - Internet
   - WAN
   - LAN

2. What type of network connects offices in different buildings?
   - Internet
   - WAN
   - LAN

3. What network is used when browsing www.google.com from a smartphone (not connected to Wi-Fi)?
   - Internet
   - WAN
   - LAN

#### 2. MAC and IP address
**Questions:**
1. What is a MAC address?
   - Name of a network interface
   - Unique identifier of a network interface
   - A network interface

2. What is an IP address?
   - Like a postal address to houses for devices connected to a network
   - Unique identifier of a network interface
   - A number that network devices use to connect to networks

#### 3. UDP and TCP
**Questions:**
1. Which statement is correct for the TCP box?
  

 - Protocol transferring data slowly but surely
   - Protocol transferring data fast and might lose data along the way

2. Which statement is correct for the UDP box?
   - Protocol transferring data slowly but surely
   - Protocol transferring data fast and might lose data along the way

3. Which statement is correct for the TCP worker?
   - Have you received boxes x, y, z?
   - May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?

- [File: 3-UDP_and_TCP](https://github.com/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x07-networking_basics/3-UDP_and_TCP)

#### 4. TCP and UDP ports
- Write a Bash script that displays listening ports.
- Show only listening sockets.
- Show PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.

**Example:**
```bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo ./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 *:sunrpc                *:*                     LISTEN      518/rpcbind
tcp        0      0 *:ssh                   *:*                     LISTEN      1240/sshd
tcp6       0      0 [::]:sunrpc             [::]:*                  LISTEN      518/rpcbind

#### 5. Is the host on the network
- Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
- Accepts a string as an argument.
- Displays "Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}" if no argument passed.
- Pings the IP 5 times.

**Example:**
```bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./5-is_the_host_on_the_network 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=12.9 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=13.6 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=7.83 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=63 time=11.3 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=5 ttl=63 time=7.57 ms

--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 4006ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 7.570/10.682/13.679/2.546 ms
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./5-is_the_host_on_the_network
Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}
